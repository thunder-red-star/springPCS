My idea for the final project
==============================

I will probably be using Java to implement a text editor, similar to vim. I'll be using ANSI escape codes for the text
highlighting, and also to set cursor positions. The text will be stored in an invisible temp file, and the file will be
read and written to during the program's execution. The program will be able to save the file to a file, and also load a
file. The program will also be able to undo and redo actions.

We'll be using stacks to implement undo and redo, and to match parentheses, brackets, and braces. We'll be using queues
to implement the search and replace functions.
