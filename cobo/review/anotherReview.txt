This place was *amazing! It had the *best pizza in the world, and the Curt Coins were just *cute! The pizza was just *right, *crispy and *thin. There are so *many toilets, they could accommodate a *huge football team! I asked for a *full body massage, and got not just that but also a *delicious pizza!
