Such an awful place.
They won't deliver to San Antonio! The pizza was too flat.
They wouldn't accept cheeseburgers as a topping. They wouldn't accept my currency that I made up, Curt Coins.
There aren't nearly enough toilets to accommodate a football team.
I asked for a full body massage, and they gave me pizza.
