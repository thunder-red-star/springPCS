HW101 -- A Heap of Trouble
2022-05-16
Time spent: ~0.4 hours


Discoveries:
- N/A

Questions Comments Concerns:
- We implemented the reheapify portion of each method within the methods' algorithms, but wouldn't it be cleaner to just
  have the methods call the reheapify method?
- We never implemented swap even though it's elementary and doesn't really need describing for the algorithm.
